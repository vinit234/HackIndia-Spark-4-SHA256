Crowdfunding with Milestone-Based Escrow and Decentralized Governance
This project implements a crowdfunding platform on the Polygon testnet using Thirdweb, React, and Ethers.js. The platform allows users to create campaigns, donate funds, and vote on the release of funds based on milestone achievements. All funds are held in escrow until milestones are approved by backers through decentralized voting.

Features
Create Campaigns: Campaign owners can create new crowdfunding campaigns with a target amount, milestones, and deadlines.
Milestone Voting: Backers vote on whether a milestone has been successfully achieved. Funds are released only when milestones are approved.
Donation: Users can donate ETH to any active campaign.
Decentralized Governance: Backers of a campaign vote on milestones, determining whether the funds should be released.
